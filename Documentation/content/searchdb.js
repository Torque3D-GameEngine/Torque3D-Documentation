Particle effects are things such as fire balls, smoke, and water splashes that you create and place into your levels. The Torque 3D Particle Editor is the tool of choice for full control over the look and feel of your effects. At its most basic level a particle effect consists of: an emitter, a particle to be emitted from the emitter, and an image rendered to represent that particle. The emitter controls: the creation of the particles; their movement; which directions the particles will travel, also referred to as the spread pattern and: how each particle blends into the world. The particle controls its own life span, what image will be shown; how big the image is; what its color over time is; and some basic force settings.

This tool can preview and edit materials mapped to an object in real time from the World Editor. Materials are categorized for ease of organization, and the editor is designed to be backwards-compatible with any existing script files. Materials are defined within script files named materials.cs Typical Use The Material Editor quickly comes into play when you are building your level by placing objects into the scene. As an example situation, let us assume you have a light fixture you or another artist has exported for use in Torque 3D. The creation of this object was a multi-step process. The objects geometry had to be created in a 3D modeling app, such as 3DS Max, Maya or Blender. Once the geometry was finished, a 2D graphical application was used to create the various textures that make up the high quality appearance: base texture (diffuse map), normal map, detail map, etc. The rendered view of this object looks fine in the originating application, which leads you to believe it is ready to be imported into your games level. When you drop the lighting fixture into the world, there is a good chance it will fit right in based on your existing design. The theme and color scheme are likely a match. However, once your object is in the level you might notice something is off. While the stand alone object viewed in an external tool looked great, the object now seems out of sync with your levels lighting, tone, or specific room theme. This is not the fault of the artist or design. What has happened is the materials for your object have either not been assigned or need to be tweaked to perfection in specific instances. Instead of going back into the art tool or adjusting properties in code, you can use the Material Editor      ");

The T3D Datablock Editor is used to quickly and easily change any parameter of any datablock from within the world Editor. Setup From the T3D Toolbox, select your project and load the Empty Terrain level. Once T3D loads, open the world editor (F11) if it is not open already. Interface To switch to the Datablock Editor press the F6 key or from the main menu select Editors Datablock Editor. menu&gt;Editors&gt; Datablock Editor Or alternately click the Datablock icon from the World Editor toolbar. The Datablock editor has two components: the Datablock Library pane and the Datablock properties pane. These panes appear at the right of the screen whenever the Datablock Editor is active. The Datablock Library pane is further divided into two tabs. The first, labelled Existing, contains a categorized list of all the existing datablocks. The second, labelled New, is used to create new instances of those datablocks. Clicking any existing datablock will cause the Datablock properties pane to update to display the current properties of that datablock. The image below shows the selection of the DefaultCar datablock, under the WheeledVehicleData category. This datablock contains variables related to vehicle performance. Creating a new Datablock Creating a new datablock can be done by creating a copy from an already existing datablock. To do so first select the New tab in the Datablock Library pane. Then choose the type of datablock you wish to create from the list. Then press the New icon. You will be presented with a new window giving you the option to name the new datablock and to copy values from one of the existing instances of the datablock type, if you want to. For example, in this scenar      ");

This includes adding and modifying terrains, buildings, foliage, cloud layers, vehicles, environmental effects, lighting effects, and much more. Aside from the Toolbox, the World Editor is the first (and most important) tool a new user should learn. A sample game level as seen inside the World Editor: (click to enlarge) The World Editor is not a tool for creating game objects. Objects must be created using applications appropriate for the object type (i.e., 3DS Max to create a 3D model). However, once an object is loaded it can be modified by the World Editor in a variety of ways. The simplest modification would be a change in scale (size), but more complex modifications are also possible. For example, the Torque Material Editor can be used to alter (or completely replace) textures on a 3D object or add shader effects. A typical World Editor workflow might go as follows (in very simplified terms): Create a 3D model in an application like 3DS Max, Maya, or Blender. Save that model to a sub folder inside your game/art directory. Launch World Editor (which will automatically find that model if step 2 was done correctly). Add the model to your level; position, scale, rotate, and adjust its materials as desired. Test your changes in-game with the push of a single button. Return to the World Editor and continue to tweak your level. Of course, there is a lot more to the World Editor than positioning 3D models. You will also be working with 2D assets like grey scale height-maps to create terrains, as well as specialized tools for creating rivers, forests, and roads. Finally, it is worth noting that Torque 3D includes numerous art assets for you to play with… so you can skip steps 1 and 2 above and start building game levels right away!

Terrain is represented in a game level by a TerrainBlock. In order to follow along with this article using World Builder, you must either create a new game project or open an existing project. There are three methods to add a TerrainBlock to a level: (1) Create a blank terrain; (2) Add an existing .ter file; and (3) Import a heightmap. Creating Blank Terrain To create a new blank terrain start from the menu by selecting FileCreate Blank Terrain. After you click the menu entry, a Create New Terrain Dialog will appear. The Name field allows you to specify a name for your TerrainBlock. This name will appear in the Scene Tree and can be used to reselect your terrain later for editing. Enter a name for the terrain in the text box, in this example theterrain. The Material for the terrain, that is the texture that will be displayed to depict the ground cover, is selected using a drop-down list. This list is populated by the World builder with all the existing materials created specifically for terrains. The Resolution that you select from that drop-down list determines the size of the terrain that will be created. The size of the terrain that you choose is largely dependent on the design of your game. You will have to experiment to find the right size that works for each game you create and some combinations of options are not very practical. For example, selecting a terrain size of 256 and using the Noise option will result in a terrain that is so drastically contoured that it will not be of much use. The radio buttons to the right of the Resolution dropdown determine the smoothness of the terrain that is generated. Selecting Flat will create a relatively smooth terrain and selecti      ");

This includes players, items, weapons, vehicles, props, buildings, and so on. Currently Torque 3D supports three model formats: DTS, COLLADA, and DIF. DTS: Short for Dynamix Three Space, this is a proprietary format first developed by a company called Dynamix for its game named Tribes. This has been the primary format used by Torque Technology for importing and rendering 3D model information. The format is binary, which means it is not in a human readable format. COLLADA: Short for COLLAborative Design Activity. COLLADA is emerging as the format for interchanging models between DCC (Digital-Content-Creation) applications. The file extension used to identify COLLADA files is .dae which stand for digital asset exchange. The COLLADA format has several key benefits: all of the geometry and texture information is readily available in a single file; nearly every major 3D modeling application is able to export directly to the COLLADA format; and the data is stored in an open standard XML schema, which means it can be read and tweaked manually, if need be, in any text editor rather than requiring a specific application. DIF: Short for Dynamix Interior File, this is another proprietary format developed during the Tribes days which is used by Torque. DIFs (also called Interiors) are primarily used for buildings or other enclosing structures within game levels. This format is currently being deprecated and will eventually be removed from the engine. We recommend creating all of your asssets as DTS or COLLADA files. Adding A DTS Model Before you can add a DTS model to World Builder so that it can be placed in a game level, it must be created with an appropriate application. It must then be placed in a folder where the World Builder can find it. When the World Editor is started i      ");

As the name implies, the ScatterSky object produces the sky. Additionally, it includes level lighting, sun positioning, and a hook for time of day manipulation. This can be used for a fully functioning day/night system. Setup This article was written using a newly generated project with the Full Template, which ships with plenty of free assets for testing and learning. To save time and focus on this specific section of the World Editor documentation, we are going to bypass asset creation until later on. Delete Existing Sun and Skybox Every new mission starts with both Skybox and Sun objects. Since the ScatterSky object contains the functionality of those two objects embedded within it they must be removed in order to use a ScatterSky in the level. To delete the existing Skybox, switch to the Object Editor tool and locate your Scene Tree panel. Select the Scene tab. You should see a single Skybox object in the MissionGroup. Select the object and delete it. The Skybox object should no longer be present in the Scene Tree. More importantly, the sky has now been removed from your level. Because nothing is rendered beyond a Skybox, Torque 3D will be rendering absolutely nothing where the object used to exist. (click to enlarge) If your level is currently lit, you can see the terrain. This means there is already a Sun object in your level. Since a ScatterSky also contains its own sun, we will need to clear the level of any conflicts.

The first section is oriented towards level designers, artists, and people who are new to Torque 3D and do not need to dive into the source code. The second section is oriented towards programmers who will be working with the source code of the engine. New Users, Scripters, and Artists Now that you have decided to work with Torque 3D, this section will take you through setting up your environment. If you are using the demo or are primarily using the tools, the setup of Torque 3D is simple. You need the latest DirectX runtime. You can download this here. Depending on your User Account Control settings in Windows Vista or Windows 7, you may be prompted to allow the installer to run. Read the agreement and choose to accept it. Click Next to install the latest version of DirectX. Also, make sure that your video and sound drivers are up-to-date with the latest versions. Doing an Internet search on the video or graphics card or visiting the manufacturer web site will usually lead to downloads of the latest drivers. Once these have been installed, you are ready to hit the ground running. Below are some of the common hardware vendor site. Check your system requirements to find your vendor and hardware model.

Standard switch statements use numerical values to determine which case to execute: switch Syntax: switch(&lt;numeric expression&gt;) { case value0: statements; case value1: statements; case value3: statements; default: statements; } Switch statements requiring string comparison use the switch syntax. switch Syntax: switch (&lt;string expression&gt;) { case string value 0: statements; case string value 1: statements; ... case string value N: statements; default: statements; } Creating the Script First, we need to create a new script: Navigate to your projects game/scripts/client directory.

Numbers can also be stored in string format. Standard strings are stored in double-quotes. abcd (string) Example: UserName = Heather; Strings with single quotes are called tagged strings. abcd (tagged string) Tagged strings are special in that they contain string data, but also have a special numeric tag associated with them. Tagged strings are used for sending string data across a network. The value of a tagged string is only sent once, regardless of how many times you actually do the sending. On subsequent sends, only the tag value is sent. Tagged values must be de-tagged when printing. You will not need to use a tagged string often unless you are in need of sending strings across a network often, like a chat system. There are special values you can use to concatenate strings and variables. Concatenation refers to the joining of multiple values into a single variable. The following is the basic syntax: string 1 operation string 2 You can use string operators similarly to how you use mathematical operators (=, +, -, *).

String concatenation, comparison, and auto-string-constant creation. Function packaging. Variable Names Type Syntax Example Explanation Global prefix a a is a global variable Local prefix % %b %b is a local variable Array (Global or Local) postfix [] MyArray[n] Array MyMultiArray[n,m] MyMultiArrayn_m Multi-dimensional array Note: TorqueScript does not have support for arrays as such. Instead, the bracket notation is a shorthand for creating a variable name. a[0] is synonymous with a0, and M[1,4] with M1_4. You must not think of a as the name of the array containing a[5]. TorqueScript arrays provide the means for creating variable names dynamically: if i is 5, then a[i] is synonymous with a5. Constants Type Example Explanation Boolean TRUE 1       ");

The language itself is derived from the scripting used for Tribes 2, which was the base tech Torque evolved from. Scripts are written and stored in .cs files, which are compiled and executed by a binary compiled via the C++ engine (.exe for Windows or .app OS X). The CS extension should not be confused with C# files. The CS extension stands for C Script, meaning the language resembles C programming. Though there is a connection, TorqueScript is a much higher level language, which is easier to learn than standard C or C++. Basic Usage Like most other scripting languages, such as Python or Java Script, TorqueScript is a high-level programming language interpreted by Torque 3D at run time. Unlike C++, you can write your code in script and run it without recompiling your game. All of your interfaces can be built using the GUI Editor, which saves the data out to TorqueScript. The same goes for data saved by the World Editor or Material Editor. Most of the editors themselves are C++ components exposed and constructed via TorqueScript. More importantly, nearly all of your game play programming will be written in TorqueScript: inventory systems, win/lose scenarios,      ");

Uses the AITurretShapeData datablock, which is based on the TurretShapeData datablock for common properties. AITurretShape builds an AI controlled turret. It uses a state machine and properties as defined in AITurretShapeData to decide how to find targets and what to do with them. As with TurretShape (which AITurretShape derives from) the AITurretShape class provides the base on which ShapeBaseImageData weapons may be mounted. Overview The AITurretShape functions through the use of a state machine as defined in its AITurretShapeData datablock. It is very similar to how ShapeBaseImageData works. This allows you to customize exactly how the turret behaves while it searches for a target, and what it does once it has a target. But in general, the AI turret goes through a number of stages: Scanning The AI turret usually starts off by scanning for a suitable target. This is done by checking for targets within a pie wedge shaped volume in front of the turret based on where the scanPoint node is placed. The turret takes cover into account when searching for a target so that it doesnt cheat. Gained Target Once a target is acquired the turret attempts to follow it. Usually at this point the turret activates its weapon. If a target is lost due to it going behind cover, the turret will attempt to follow and reacquire the target using its last known position and velocity. The amount of time allowed for this attempt is defined by AITurretShapeData::trackLostTargetTime. Lost Target If the target is lost (either by going behind cover or it is dead) the turret returns to its scanning mode to find another victim. Destroyed If the AI turret is destroyed then it can go into a special state to show t      ");

Unlike other datablocks, ShapeBaseImageData does not have a base class associated with it. Instead, this datablock is an abstraction of geometry that can only be mounted to a ShapeBase object and is only used by a ShapBase object. The most common use for ShapeBaseImageData objects (referred to as Images hereafter) is for weapons carried by a Player or Vehicle object, and much of the functionality provided by the Image is aimed at that use-case. Images include a powerful state machine to control animations, sounds, script callbacks, and state transitions. This state system is downloaded to the client so that clients can predict state changes and animate accordingly. The following example - a grenade launcher weapon - demonstates the flexibility of the system. The weapon includes states and transitions to handle the normal ready-&gt;fire-&gt;reload-&gt;ready loop as well as noammo-&gt;dryfire for firing when the weapon is out of ammo.

Proximity mines can be deployed using the world editor or thrown by an in-game object. Once armed, any Player or Vehicle object that moves within the mines trigger area will cause it to explode. Internally, the ProximityMine object transitions through the following states: Thrown: Mine has been thrown, but has not yet attached to a surface Deployed: Mine has attached to a surface but is not yet armed. Start playing the armingSound and armed sequence. Armed: Mine is armed and will trigger if a Vehicle or Player object moves within the trigger area. Triggered: Mine has been triggered and will explode soon. Invoke the onTriggered callback, and start playing the triggerSound and triggered sequence. Exploded: Mine has exploded and will be deleted on the server shortly. Invoke the onExplode callback on the server and generate the explosion effects on the client. Note: Proximity mines with the static field set to true will start in the Armed state. Use this for mines placed with the World Editor. The shape used for the mine may optionally define the following sequences: armed Sequence to play when the mine is deployed, but before it becomes active and triggerable (armingDelay should be set appropriately). triggered Sequence to play when the mine is triggered, just before it explodes (triggerDelay should be set appropriately).

Projectiles Projectiles are what we use in T3D for most bullets, rockets, grenades, and all objects of the like. Typically a projectile is created in the WeaponImage::OnFire call like so: // Create the projectile object %p = new (%this.projectileType) { dataBlock = %this.projectile; initialVelocity = %muzzleVelocity; initialPosition = %obj.getMuzzlePoint(%slot); sourceObject = %obj; sourceSlot = %slot; client = %obj.client; }; MissionCleanup.add(%p); // MissionCleanup is a SimGroup. Once created, a projectile will move from its initialPosition in the direction of its initial velocity. It will travel along this path until it comes in contact with a sceneObject. (This includes the terrain.) where it will either bounce, or explode depending on how the projectiles datablock has been setup. Before the projectile actually explodes, it uses its onExplode callback in script before actualling the explode() code in C++. This gives scriptors a chance to affect the behavior of the projectile before the engine actually processes an explosion, or to do any last minute tricks, hacks, or checks before it explodes. Its important to keep in mind that the onExplode callback will only be done server side.

The Player object is the main client-controlled object in an FPS, or indeed, any game where the user is in control of a single character. This class (and the associated datablock, PlayerData) allows you to fine-tune the movement, collision detection, animation, and SFX properties of the character. Player derives from ShapeBase, so it is recommended to have a good understanding of that class (and its parent classes) as well. Movement The Player class supports the following modes of movement, known as poses: Stand Sprinting Crouching Prone Swimming The acceleration, maximum speed, and bounding box for each mode can be set independently using the PlayerData datablock. The player will automatically switch between swimming and one of the other 4 dry modes when entering/exiting the water, but transitions between the non-swimming modes are handled by controller input (such as holding down a key to begin crouching). mvTriggerCount3 activates crouching, while mvTriggerCount4 activates being prone. It is important to set the bounding box correctly for each mode so that collisions with the player remain accurate: When the player changes pose a new PlayerData callback onPoseChange() is called. This is being used as Armor::onPoseChange() to modify an animation prefix used by ShapeBaseImageData to allow the 1st person arms to change their animation based on pose. Example:function Armor::onPoseChange(%this, %obj, %oldPose, %newPose) { // Set the script anim prefix to be that of the current pose %obj.setImageScriptAnimPrefix( WeaponSlot, addTaggedString(%newPose) ); } Another feature       ");

Additionally, the Torque 3D Camera object has been changed from previous versions of Torque. Major changes include Smoothing effects apply to all modes Two new modes are included Game play and editor specific cameras Usage documentation provided for all modes Camera Modes Stationary: The camera is fixed in space and isnt allowed to move. All user input is ignored. FreeRotate: The camera is fixed in space, but the user is allowed to rotate it. Fly: The user may control the camera using Forward/Backward/Left/Right/Up/Down. Controls are relative to the cameras current view direction - forward moves the camera toward whatever its looking at. OrbitObject: The camera is fixed in orbit around a particular object, with optional offset. The user may control the cameras angle, but not what the camera is looking at. If another object comes between the camera and orbited object, the camera will move inward so that its view is unobstructed. OrbitPoint: Similar to OrbitObject, except that instead of orbiting an object (which may be mobile), the camera orbits a fixed point in the world. If an object comes between the camera and the orbited point, the camera will move inward so that its view is unobstructed. TrackObject: The camera is fixed in space, and rotates to keep a particular object in the center of view( again, with optional offset). Like the Stationary mode, user input is ignored. Overhead: The user may control the camera using Forward/Backward/Left/Right/Up/Down. Unlike the Fly camera, Forward/Backward/Lef      ");

Each summary includes further details on each new feature. Teleporters Teleporters are Trigger objects that have a specific behaviour. You define a teleporter with a TriggerData datablock with some special fields defined. datablock TriggerData(TeleporterTrigger : DefaultTrigger) { // Amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait before allowing another // object to use this teleportat. teleporterCooldown = 0; // Amount to scale the objects exit velocity. Larger values will // propel the object with greater force. exitVelocityScale = 0; // If true, the object will be oriented to the front // of the exit teleporter. Otherwise the player will retain their original // orientation. reorientPlayer = true; // If true, the teleporter will only trigger if the object // enters the front of the teleporter. oneSided = false; // Effects to play at the entrance of the teleporter. entranceEffect = EntranceEffect; exiteffect = EntranceEffect; // 2D Sound to play for the client being teleported. teleportSound = TeleportSound; }; When you define a teleporter you also need to have an exit as defined by the instances exit field, which is another object in the level -- usually another teleporter trigger. Also note that this just defines the trigger itself. If you want your teleporter to have a shape youll need to add a shape object to the level, such as a TSStatic. Weapon Clip System Weapons may now use the optional ammunition clip system. To make use of the clip system each weapon needs to define two ItemData datablocks. The first is the clip itself, which needs to be part of the AmmoClip class. Here is an example: datablock ItemData(LurkerClip) { // Mission editor category category = AmmoClip; className = AmmoClip; // Basic Item propertie      ");

The stock Torque 3D installation includes dozens of folders and thousands of files. It is easy to be overwhelmed at first, but if you spend a little time to browse through the directory hierarchy while reading along with the Directory and Torque 3D Project Tours below, youll find that everything is organized in a straightforward and intuitive manner. Following the tours, we have also included a brief description of the file types you will encounter while using Torque 3D. SDK Tour Folder Description This is your Torque 3D root directory. From here, you can navigate through the rest of the SDK. Most importantly, the Torque 3D Toolbox is located in this directory. This is what you will run when you wish to create new projects, edit existing ones, run the editors, and so on. The Demos folder contains sample projects that serve a specific purpose. These projects are meant to show off engine features, and not game play or tutorials. You can use these projects as a reference on how other developers have prototyped simple demonstrations with Torque 3D tech. A project in the Demos folder acts as a stand alone Torque 3D application. The folder structure and core files are similar to what you may find in other standard projects. Exactly how a Torque 3D project is structured is covered here. The Documentation folder is self-descriptive. In this directory, you can find the Official Documentation for Torque 3D (the documentation you are currently reading). This is also where the Engine Reference docs will be located. A large portion of the Torque 3D SDK is kept in the Engine directory. The libraries, binaries, and source files that allow you to build the Torque 3D engine are located here. The Bin folder contains the bin      ");

Torque 3D was created by GarageGames to make the development of games easier, faster, and more affordable. It is a professional Software Development Kit (SDK) that will save you the effort required to build a rendering system, high speed multiplayer networking, real time editors, a scripting system, and much more. As part of Torque 3D, you receive full access to 100% of our engine source code. This means that you can add to, alter, or optimize any component of the engine down to the lowest level C++ rendering calls. That being said, you dont need to be an experienced C++ programmer to use Torque 3D. In fact, you do not need to know C++ at all. Using TorqueScript and the collection of tools that are included with Torque 3D, you can build complete games (of many different genres) without ever touching a single line of C++ code. To understand the basics of how the engine is setup and the tools available, a short reference is included below. Further sections in the documentation explain these tools in more depth. System Requirements OS: Windows XP SP3/Vista/Windows 7 Processor: 1.7 GHz Processor or better Memory: WinXP - 1GB RAM/WinVista, Win7  2GB RAM Graphics: Graphics: DirectX 9.0c Shader 3.0 supported, Nvidia 6800 or 7300 or better, ATI Radeon X1300 or better DirectX: 9.0c Hard Drive: 4 Gb free disk space Other Requirements: Nvidia (AGEIA) PhysX The Engine The engine handles all of the elements of a game that run in real time on your computer. The Torque 3D engine is written entirely in C++ and is fully accessible to you as a developer. This means you have access to the inner workings of the code to customize it for your needs. The end result is that Torque 3D allows developers to add functionality, increase optimization, and learn how everything works.

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. It is the summation of all the controls (windows, buttons, text fields, etc.) that are used to interact with a game and its settings. Most interfaces in games consist of buttons to launch or join a game session, editing devices to change user preferences, options to change screen resolutions and rendering options, and elements which display game data to the user as they are playing. GUI creation and design is extremely important to game development. Many decent games have been crippled by inaccessible GUIs, which is why having a built in GUI editor can be a blessing. The Torque 3D editor provides drag and drop functionality, with minimal fill in the blank requirements. Torque 3D GUIs GUIs are saved as a script (.gui), which allows you to further tweak values using your favorite text editor. Additionally, you can declare variables and define functions at the end of a GUI script, which will not be written over when modifying the GUI using Torques editor. Multiple controls which can be combined to make up a single interface. Each control is contained in a single structure, which can be embedded into other GUI elements to form a tree. The following is an example of a GUI control which displays a picture: // Bitmap GUI control new GuiBitmapCtrl() { profile = GuiDefaultProfile; horizSizing = width; vertSizing = height; position = 8 8; extent = 384 24; minExtent = 8 8; visible = 1; helpTag = 0; bitmap = art/gui/images/swarmer.png; wrap = 0; }; Once the above GUI is active in your interface, it will display the following: GUI Editor Torque 3D features a WYSIWYG GUI Editor, which allows you to create, edit, and test your GUI in game with maximum fidelity. 90% of your GUI creation can be done in the editor, leaving 10% for scripting advanced functionality.

The most intuitive way is to use the Toolbox. Run the Toolbox, select a project, then press the GUI Editor shortcut: Your project will begin to load. Before the game is actually launched, a screen will appear allowing to pick which GUI you want to start editing: (click to enlarge) Once you have selected a starting GUI, the editor will fully load. From here, you can edit your selection, load a different GUI, or create an entirely new one. The alternate method to loading the GUI Editor is to press the shortcut key while running a game: Windows users press F10, OS X users press cmd + F10. You can perform this action at anytime while running your game. The same shortcut will also quit the GUI Editor, so make sure you save your progress before you quit. Main Editor Sections The main GUI Editor view consists of 5 primary sections: File Menu - Found at the very top, this is where you will find various menus that controls global functionality of the editor, such as creating/saving GUI files, manually locking, selecting, and aligning controls, toggle snapping, and so on. The Toolbar - Located just below the File Menu, this bar contains shortcuts to the GUI Selector, resolution adjuster, and common positioning actions (nudge, align, etc). Control Palette - The Control Palette contains all of the controls you can add to your current GUI. You can click a control in the list or manually drag it to a position in the view to add it to the scene. GUI Tree Panel - This panel, located on the far right, contains all of the controls that make up your current GUI. They are listed in hierarchical tree, which is sorted by oldest to most recent (top to bottom) and parenting (described later). GUI Inspector Panel - This panel, found directly      ");

If you have not done so already, make sure you read the following docs first: Environment Setup Torque 3D Directory Overview GFX Core You can find the core GFX files in engine/gfx. Some of the source files in this system are meant to be sub-classed based on platform. There are currently 4 main gfxDevice classes: GFXDevice GFXD3D9Device (inside the D3D9 directory) GFXGLDevice (inside the gl directory) GFXNullDevice (inside the Null directory) As you can see, each platform gets its own GFXDevice. The same goes for other platform dependent files: gfxShader, gfxCubemap, gfxVertexBuffer, and so on. Some of the other source files are stand-alone. For instance, gfxStructs.h contains classes/structs and functions used by all platforms. This usually involves generic information, such as GFXLightInfo containing light type, position, etc. DirectX (D3D, D3D9) Since Torque 3D supports cross-platform compatibility, it is important to keep the GFX layers separate. The D3D folder contains only two files: screenshotD3D.h and screenshotD3D.cpp. Just as the name implies, these two files are used in capturing screens while running a game, currently D3D9 only. Youll see the major platform specific classes represented here, such as the GFXdevice, TextureManager, VertexBuffer, etc. The functionality remains the same, but the application and execution are specific to the API. OpenGL (gl and ggl) Much like the D3D sections, the gl folder and its files contain rendering functionality specifically meant to run on a Mac. Once again, the major systems are integrated into the OpenGL layer (StateBlock, GFXDevice, PrimitiveBuffer, etc). Within the gl directory is another folder: ggl.

If youve written rendering code before, you may have written code similar to this before: // Enable Blending glEnable (GL_BLEND); // Set The Blend Mode glBlendFunc (GL_SRC_ALPHA ,GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) What if you need to setup that kind of rendering state more than just once? GFXStateblocks allow you to wrap that up into the following: GFX-&gt;setStateBlock(myState); Theres a little more tech and setup involved, but the above example should be enough to encourage you to read on and use this concept in your own project. Technical Description Using GFXStateblocks allows you to pre-generate your rendering states, which is going to save you time, cleanup your code, apply modern rendering techniques, and give you more control over your games rendering from the engine as well as script. When combined with CustomMaterials, the material definitions in script need less custom engine support. Stateblocks are created by filling out a GFXStateBlockDesc structure and calling GFX-&gt;createStateBlock on it. This returns a GFXStateBlockRef, which is a reference-counted GFXStateBlock. This is essentially a GFXResource, just like a texture. Then you use a stateblock by calling GFX-&gt;setStateBlock and passing the state block in. Using a stateblock fully defines a render state, which completely does away with all concepts canonical. This is actually a good thing as this will reduce bugs introduced because a state was not properly cleaned up before exiting. Source Code It might help if we tour the engine code, so you can get some concrete code samples in front of your eyes. Start by opening gfxStateBlock.h and gfxStateBlock.cpp, both of which are found i      ");

This concept is quite similar to DirectX 10s version of constant buffers, which share a similar purpose: Quoted concepts from DirectX HLSL MSDN: A constant buffer, or shader constant buffer, is a buffer that contains shader constants. Conceptually, it looks just like a single-element vertex buffer. A constant buffer is a specialized buffer resource that is accessed like a buffer. A buffer resource is designed to minimize the overhead of setting shader constants. Technical Description A shader constant buffer is just a block of memory (or an object) that contains the constants that a shader needs to have bound. Specifically, they buffer a collection of string/value pairs that are sent to a shader. They are allocated by the shader itself because the shader may have information about layout that no other part of the system will know about. You can look up handles by shader constant name. This removes the need for a static shader constant-to-slot mapping and also allows us to do some CPU side optimizations. Under the hood, the string/value pair is mapped to a block of memory that can be handed to a shader with one call. Source Code We are going to take a light tour of the engine code that makes up the GFXShaderConstBuffer system. Lets start by opening engine/source/gfx/gfxShader.h. Toward the top of this header, you will see a struct and two base classes that make up this system: /// Instances of this struct are returned GFXShaderConstBuffer struct GFXShaderConstDesc {...}; /// This is an opaque handle used by GFXShaderConstBuffer /// clients to set individual shader constants. /// Derived classes can put whatever info they need into here, /// these handles are owned by the shader constant buffer /// (or shader).

RenderInst RenderInst is a base structure for more task-specific render managers. The current version of RenderInst only contains information on sorting, translucency, and rendering type overrides. ObjectRenderInst ObjectRenderInst is a derived from RenderInst. It does not actually contain any information about meshes, materials, transforms, etc. However, it makes use of a very important feature: Delegate callbacks. MeshRenderInst Derived from RenderInst, a MeshRenderInst object contains the critical data needed for rendering. It is declared directly below ObjectRenderInst. Within this structure is an objects geometry(mesh), lighting information, textures, transforms, and base material. Some of the most basic classes are used in MeshRenderInst: GFXVertexBufferHandleBase and GFXPrimitiveBufferHandle handle the vertex buffer and primitive buffer (respectively) World transforms and object-to-world transforms are handled by MatrixF pointers LightInfo pointers retain information for primary and secondary lighting GFXTextureObject pointers also aid in lighting, as well as texturing the object. RenderBinManager RenderBinManager is the first manager we are going to cover. In essence, RenderBinManager manages and signals a main list of RenderInst objects. RenderBinManager contains the variables and functions necessary for adding, processing, sorting, and clearing RenderInst objects. To get a closer look at RenderBinManager, open engine/source/renderInstance/renderBinManager.h and renderBinManager.cpp. Most of the important management functionality is defined in the class, but you should notice a very important chunk of functionality missing: rendering code.

RenderDelgates are based on the system sending a signal, which is caught by an objects RenderDelegate. The RenderDelgate itself calls an objects render function. Lets take a look at a few simple examples. SkyBox Example The SkyBox object is a great example of a custom object that requires rendering. The class is derived from SceneObject, which does not have a rendering function. Open engine/source/environment/skyBox.h. If you scroll through the SkyBox class, you will find the declaration of its RenderDelegate: /// Our render delegate. void _renderObject( ObjectRenderInst *ri, SceneState *state, BaseMatInstance *mi ); Open skyBox.cpp (same directory), then locate the SkyBox::prepRenderImage(...) function. At the bottom of the function, Skys RenderDelegate is bound. In the following code, read each lines comment to understand what is happening: // Create a render instance by asking the RenderPassManager for one ObjectRenderInst *ri = state-&gt;getRenderPass()-&gt;allocInst&lt;ObjectRenderInst&gt;(); // Bind the SkyBoxs rendering function to the renderDelegate ri-&gt;renderDelegate.bind( this, &SkyBox::_renderObject ); // Set the Render Instance Type (RIT) ri-&gt;type = RenderPassManager::RIT_Sky; // Set the sorting keys ri-&gt;defaultKey = 10; ri-&gt;defaultKey2 = 0; // Add the render instance to the manager state-&gt;getRenderPass()-&gt;addInst( ri ); When binding, we are passing in the SkyBox class (this), and its rendering function. Lets say the rendering function had a different name, such as _renderSky. ri-&gt;renderDelegate.bind( this, &SkyBox::_renderSky); What we are doing is preparing the SkyBox class to receive a render signal and act on it.

When working in the engine, you will want to focus on the source code related to your target platform: Windows - GFX-&gt;D3D9 for rendering. Input, window management, and general Windows components are handled by platformWin32, windowManager-win32, and a few other filters which will be detailed in the GFX Engine Tour. Mac OSX - GFX-&gt;gl for rendering. platformMac and windowManager-&gt;mac handle input, window management, and other Mac components.

It was designed to provide the basic features for sound playback across multiple platforms, sound devices, and audio libraries. This guide is a high level overview of the SFX module and what systems it supports. Recommendation: For the best cross-platform support as well as for the best compatibility with future additions to SFX, it is recommended to either use OpenAL or FMOD with SFX. A number of future additions will likely not be supported with other sound APIs. Two Playback Types Each individual sound can be played back in two ways. The type of playback used by the sound system for a particular sound is determined by the isStreamingproperty of its SFXDescription Note: With either form of playback, sound data is stored in uncompressed form on the device. For compressed formats, decompression occurs during sound loading. For streamed sounds, this is a continuous process. All sound loading happens on worker threads regardless of how it is played back so it does not tax the main thread. Buffered DEFINITION: Sample data completely offloaded to a sound device in one contiguous chunk. Ideal for small sounds, such as place once effects (e.g. gun fire, collision audio, etc). Advantages Fast seeking No overhead after loading Sound data can be shared between simultaneous playbacks Disadvantages May consume a lot of memory on the device (depending on sample data size) May take longer to load (depending on sample data size) May fail to load entirely depending on device (depending on sample data size) Needs entire sound stream to be available before playback can start Streamed DEFINITION: Small buffer allocated on a sound device and data is progressively loaded       ");

Buffers will be deleted when no longer used but will also be freed when the device is destroyed. Use StrongWeakRefPtrs to permanently refer to SFXBuffers so that references will null out when the buffer goes away. Loading and updating of sound buffers happens on dedicated SFX update threads created by the individual devices. For devices that do not create such a thread, updating will happen on the main thread; this, however, is currently only used by the Null device. Buffers hold raw, uncompressed PCM sample data loaded from SFXStreams. SFXBuffers for normal, buffered playback will be loaded once in entirety and may then be used by an arbitrary number of SFXVoices for concurrent playback. SFXBuffers for streamed playback will be loaded progressively in the background and are tied to a single unique SFXVoice. Important: Do not use delete directly on an SFXBuffer. Instead call destroySelf() on the buffer to delete it. Buffers may have pending asynchronous operations that need to flush out first before the buffer can actually be deleted. SFXVoice This is an abstract base class for objects on the sound device that the control playback of a particular SFXBuffer. Usually, a device will limit the number of concurrent sound playbacks it supports. SFXVoices follow the same lifecycle as SFXBuffers. An SFXVoice should never be directly deleted by clients. Leave lifetime management to reference-counting. An SFXVoice promoted to playing state when its attached SFXBuffer has not yet fully loaded will temporarily transition into SFXStatusBlocked to indicate that playback cant progress. This will also happen for streamed sounds when the playback cursor is outrunning the stream feed. SFXStream Abstract base class for reading raw PCM sample streams. Instances of subclasses will be used for all sound loading that      ");

They are created through the SFXSystem and control all aspects of playback. The SFX system can be interfaced through a number of console methods. Note: Do not create SFXSources directly through object declarations (i.e. new or singleton). This is inhibited by the SFX system. SFXSources are either created from SFXProfiles or directly from SFXStreams. The latter method is only available internally from within the engine and not exposed to script. SFXProfiles are created by the user. They combine sound files with SFXDescriptions that describe how to play back the particular file. SFXDescriptions are datablocks with a series of properties that describe aspects of sound playback. SFXSources create SFXVoices (playback controllers) and SFXBuffers (sample data buffers) on SFXDevices. This happens internally. SFXStreams are used to load sample data into SFXBuffers. For streaming buffers, this is a continuous process. This happens internally. An SFXListener instance is coupled to the SFXSystem and defines the location and velocity of the listener in 3D space. This is used for volume attenuation of 3D sounds. This happens internally. The listener is automatically updated from the games control object. Channels To allow volume level adjustment to a whole batch of sounds, sounds are grouped into logical volume channels. Music can thus be separated from sound effects or voices and have its volume adjusted independently. V      ");

This also covers how a plant will respond to a wind emitter. Here is a breakdown of how the colors affect a model: Bending of branches: controlled by the amount of red on a vertex. Normally the ends of branches are fully red, and the spot where they reach the trunk would be fully black (or colorless, depending on how you are painting...see my method below), with a smooth gradation between. Branch group instancing: So that groups of branches sway independently, they need to have varying amounts of green. Usually done by selecting a clump of branches/fronds and filling with a random shade of green (anywhere from pure green to black).

Once swapped, the pieces of the broken mesh can become physical. The physicsShape.cs file is used to tell the engine how to swap out the undamaged and damaged states. Unlike previous methods, no special PhysX plug-in is needed for your modeling program. In this much simpler method, everything is set up in physicsShape.cs file. Damaged versions can be made of multiple meshes that become physical when broken. For instance, the crate below has a single mesh made of its undamaged state (left) and four physical meshes that make up its damaged state (right): (click to enlarge) The crate is made up of two separate mesh files. Both are set up like traditional Torque 3D files, with an exception for the children of the Start Node. In this example, the meshes only have a single LOD.

This includes players, items, weapons, vehicles, props, buildings, and so on. Currently Torque 3D supports three model formats: COLLADA, DTS, and DIF. COLLADA: Short for COLLAborative Design Activity. COLLADA is emerging as the format for interchanging models between DCC(digital-content-creation) applications. The file format is .dae (digital asset exchange). The data is stored in an open standard XML schema, which means it can be read and tweaked manually if need be. DTS: Short for Dynamics Free Space, is the native, binary file format used by Torque to store shape (geometry, LOD, bone, and animation) data. DTS exporters exist for several 3D modeling packages such as 3ds Max, Maya, XSI, Blender, and Milkshape3D. DIF: Short for Dynamix Interior File, this is another proprietary format developed during the Tribes days and has survived through Torque. DIFs (also called Interiors) are primarily used for buildings or other enclosing structures. While the binary space partition (BSP) functionality is useful, using DTS or COLLADA files with Polysoup collision enabled is the preferred method and will save you time on asset generation. Adding A COLLADA Model The ability to load and render COLLADA models (.dae) is a new Torque 3D feature. The process of adding a COLLADA shape is identical to adding a DTS. You will first need to know where your .dae file is located. Again, you will open the Library-Meshes tab. Navigate to the directory containing your COLLADA model (.dae). If you hover over the item, you will get a brief file description. Go ahead and double-click on the object. The file should load extremely fast, but you may not be able to see it right away. Pull your camera up and away from its current location to see the giant shape which has been added. (click to enlarge) All of the geometry       ");

So a standard T3D character would have COLLADA files for the character’s skinned mesh and skinned skeleton as well as for the character’s animations with just the skeleton for each weapon pose. The animations can be exported individually or combined in one .dae file that is split up through the shape editor.

Many 3D modeling packages support COLLADA import and export. bmp, gif, jpeg, jpg, jng, mng, png, tga, ddsSupported texture file formats. Note that texture dimensions should be powers of 2 wherever possible such as 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, so forth, although they need not be square. Some older hardware is unable to process non-power-of-2 textures at all, and even modern hardware will pad such textures up to the next largest power of 2 when loaded which wastes VRAM. Coordinate System Torque uses the same coordinate system as 3ds Max. Characters and vehicles should be exported facing the +Y axis (or the equivalent into the screen axis if the modeling app uses a different coordinate system). When exporting to DTS, one modeling-app unit equals one unit in Torque. When exporting to COLLADA, you are free to work in whatever units you like. They will be scaled appropriately when importing the model into Torque. Normal/Bump Maps Torque uses DirectX style normal maps, where the green (Y) channel contains the DOWN vector. This is opposite to the system OpenGL uses which has the UP vector in the green channel. If your normal maps appear backwards in Torque, you may need to invert the green channel manually. 3-Space Features COLLADA and DTS Torque supports two different formats for 3D geometry and a      ");

The DTS file format stores most data in separate buffers for 8, 16 or 32-bit sized values in order to speed up loading on non-Intel platforms. A DTS file can be read as shown below; after the 3 data buffers have been created in memory, they are read in interleaved order as needed to extract the desired values (see Data Buffers).

COLLADA is emerging as the format for interchanging models between DCC (digital-content-creation) applications. Torque 3D can load geometry, material and animation data directly from COLLADA (.dae) files. The Torque 3D COLLADA loader is based on version 1.4.1 of the COLLADA specification. Many 3D modeling applications come with built-in COLLADA import and export functionality, but 3rd party plugins are also available that may be more stable, updated more frequently and give better results. In particular, OpenCOLLADA is recommended for both Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya. COLLADA &lt;unit&gt; scale When creating a model, it makes sense to work in units appropriate to the type of object being modeled. For example, it may be convenient to model a building in meters (or feet), but a small object like a pen would be better modeled in cm (or inches). Normally the modeler would be forced to choose a single unit for both objects, and one object would end up having awkward measurements; like a building that is 2000 units high, or a pen that is only 0.14 units long. This was often the case when exporting DTS models, since the convention for Torque 3D is that 1 Torque unit = 1 meter; forcing the modeler to always work in meters or apply a model-specific scale factor prior to export. COLLADA provides a mechanism to specify the units used when modeling the object. This is very important, since it allows a set of objects modeled in completely different units to be imported into Torque 3D with the correct scale relative to each other. This is done using the COLLADA &lt;unit&gt; element, which appears near the top of the .dae file and specifies the units-per-meter used for all positional values in the file       ");

The exporter ms2dtsExporterPlus.dll is an extension to MilkShape which allows it to export the DTS files used by the Torque Game Engine. Note that you must have at least Milkshape version 1.8.3 installed to use this exporter. To use the exporter, just copy ms2dtsExporterPlus.dll to your Milkshape install directory. The next time you start Milkshape, it will appear under the export list as Torque DTS Plus.... You should also copy the ms2dtsplus.chm help file to the Milkshape install directory to allow access to the documentation directly from the exporter dialogs. The new exporter can co-exist with the old exporter (ms2dtsExporter.dll). It should operate similarly to the original, and most models can be exported with very few changes. You can now view and edit meshes, materials and sequences before you export them. Changes will be applied to the model unless you hit Cancel. This exporter is not yet completed. Some features are still missing, and it is possible that there are problems with those features that are implemented. If you find an error, you can help the development of this tool by providing a description of the problem, and if possible, the .ms3d, .dts, and dump.html files involved.

The tool is invoked from the windows command prompt as follows: dae2dts [options] daeFilename Where daeFilename is the path to the COLLADA (.dae) file to convert (the DAE file does not need to be in the same folder as the dae2dts tool). The tool exit code is zero on success or non-zero on failure, making it suitable for use within a larger batch conersion process. The following options are available: --config cfgFilenameSet the conversion configuration filename. Reserved for future use; not currently supported. --output dtsFilenameSet the output DTS filename. If not specified, the output will have the same base name as the input DAE file, but with DTS (or DSQ) extension. --dsqIf set, all sequences in the shape will be saved to DSQ files (one for each sequence) instead of being embedded in the DTS file. The generated DTS file will not contain any animation sequences. --dsq-onlySame as --dsq, but no DTS file will be saved (handy for animation only input files). --compatIf set, the tool will attempt to write to DTS v24 for compatibility with non-T3D engines (TGE, TGEA, ShowToolPro etc). By default, the dae2dts tool outputs DTS v26 files which can only be loaded in T3D based products (T3D can also load DTS v24 files). DTS v24 supports only a single UV set, around 11000 maximum triangles per mesh, and does not support vertex colors. Also, COLLADA models that use autobillboards may not be saved correctly to DTS v24. --diffuseIf set, the tool will use each materials diffuse texture as the material name (instead of the COLLADA &lt;material&gt; name) for compatibility with simple TGE materials. --materialsIf set, the tool will generate a materials.cs script in the output folder to define Materials used in the shape. --verboseIf set, the tool will output progress information Examples A COLLADA model, player.dae, contains 3 animation clips: root, run, shoot. # Convert to      ");
