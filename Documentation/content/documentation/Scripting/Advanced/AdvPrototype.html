                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
                <p>In the RTS Prototype article we covered how to get started on building a 
                    Real-time Strategy or Hack &#39;n Slash type camera and movement setup.&nbsp; In 
                    this article we&#39;re going to build on some of that work to set up an Adventure 
                    camera system that allows us to set up cameras on a per-room basis.</p>
                <p>If you haven&#39;t completed the <a href="RTSPrototype.html">RTS Prototype article</a> you should do so before 
                    starting this one.&nbsp; Once you finish there you should be able to simply 
                    continue using the same project.</p>

<a name="Adding_Adventure_Cam"></a>
<h2>Adding the Adventure Camera Mode</h2>

<p>Before we get into building our level we&#39;re going to add one more camera mode to 
    our arsenal; TrackObject (or Adventure) Mode.&nbsp; This will take our 
    stationary camera and make it track a target object, like the player for 
    instance.&nbsp; In <strong>scripts/server/commands.cs</strong> add the following code at the end 
    of the file: </p>

<pre>
function serverCmdactionCam(%client)
{
   %client.camera.setTrackObject(%client.player);
}
</pre>

<p>You can use this mode if you want the camera to track the player as he walks 
    around the room.</p>
<p>Next, we&#39;ll set up our level for testing.</p>

<a name="Building_A_Level"></a>
<h2>Building A Level With Rooms</h2>

<p>Start the Torque Toolbox, select your RTS Prototype project and open the Empty 
    Terrain level&nbsp; in the World Editor.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advStartEditingLevel.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Create a Station by opening the Library tab in the Scene Tree, navigating to 
                      <strong>art/shapes/station</strong> and double-clicking <strong>station01</strong>.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advCreateStation.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Back in the Scene tab, ensure that your new TSStatic is selected.&nbsp; In the 
                      Collision section of the Inspector panel, ensure that <strong>collisionType</strong> and 
                      <strong>decalType</strong> are both set to <strong>Visible Mesh</strong>.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advStationCollisionSettings.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Position the station however you like, smooth the terrain around it and make 
                      sure that the player can easily walk into the doors of the station.</p>
                  <p>
                      Next, open the Datablock Editor (
                      <img alt="" src="images/advDBEditor.png" /> ) and create a new 
                      TriggerData called <strong>CameraRoomTrigger</strong> and copy values from DefaultTrigger.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advCreateTriggerData.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Be sure to save your new datablock (
                      <img alt="" src="images/advSave.png" /> ).</p>
                  <p>
                      Now you can start creating triggers to define your &quot;rooms&quot; within your scene.&nbsp; 
                      We&#39;re going to set it up so that when the player enters a trigger the camera is 
                      moved to the appropriate position to view the room.&nbsp; We&#39;ll start by placing 
                      one on the near side of the station.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom1Trigger.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Name the trigger <strong>Room1</strong> and ensure that you select <strong>CameraRoomTrigger</strong> as its 
                      datablock.&nbsp; Size it so that it is fairly flat and move the default spawn 
                      sphere up a bit so that the player will fall into the trigger when entering the 
                      level.&nbsp; This lets us set the camera to our first room camera angle on level 
                      start. </p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom1Settings.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Create another trigger (or copy this one by holding 
                      <strong>SHIFT</strong> while dragging it) and 
                      name it Room2.&nbsp; Place it on the other side of the station.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom2Trigger.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Again, ensure that the new trigger is named Room2 and that its datablock is set 
                      to CameraRoomTrigger.</p>
                  <p>
                      Create a third trigger named (you guessed it) Room3 and place it along the 
                      &quot;bridge&quot; part of the station.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom3Trigger.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Room 4 and 5 will be used to cover the short tower section.&nbsp; Room4 will 
                      cover the bottom portion: </p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom4Trigger.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Room5 will cover the top portion of the tower.&nbsp; You may need to adjust the 
                      heights and overlap on these two triggers to get your camera angle changes 
                      dialed in.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom5Trigger.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Room6 and Room7 will cover the taller tower.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom6Trigger.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advRoom7Trigger.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Now that the tower has been partitioned off into &quot;rooms&quot; we&#39;ll need some way to 
                      mark our camera locations.&nbsp; We can use Spawn Spheres for this, since they 
                      don&#39;t render in game but they have both position and rotation information 
                      attached to them.</p>
                  <p>
                      Move your camera to the position you want your first marker to be and get your 
                      angle dialed in.&nbsp; Once your camera is in position, open the Library tab of 
                      the Scene Tree, browse to the <strong>Level</strong> tab&#39;s <strong>Level</strong> folder and double click the 
                      <strong>Player Spawn Sphere</strong> item to create a new Spawn Sphere.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advCreateSpawnSphere.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      &nbsp;Name your new Spawn Sphere <strong>Cam1</strong>.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advCam1Create.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Pull down the <strong>Object</strong> menu and select<strong> Drop Location &gt; at Camera w/Rotation</strong>.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advSetDropOptions.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Now you can drop your Spawn Sphere so that it will be in the correct place and 
                      face the correct direction by selecting <strong>Object &gt; Drop Selection</strong> with 
                      <strong>Cam1</strong> 
                      selected.&nbsp; You can optionally use the shortcut <strong>CTRL-D</strong>.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advDropObject.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      You may see your screen turn green.&nbsp; This is not a bug, you&#39;ve just pulled 
                      the Spawn Sphere over your head and you&#39;re seeing the world through 
                      emerald-tinted glasses.&nbsp; The Spawn Sphere should be placed and facing 
                      exactly the way the camera currently is, so this is a good sign.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img alt="" src="images/advCam1Placed.png" /></p>
                  <p>
                      Next, we&#39;ll perform the same steps for the rest of our rooms.&nbsp; 
                      Move your camera into position, create a new Player Spawn Sphere and then use 
                      the Drop Selection command to place it where your camera will be.&nbsp; Name 
                      each one <strong>Cam#</strong> where the <strong>#</strong> is the same as the number on the corresponding 
                      trigger.</p>

<a name="Triggers"></a>
<h2>Hooking Up The Triggers</h2>

<p>Once all of the camera markers are placed we need to create a callback function 
    so that our camera will move when we enter our triggers.&nbsp; In <strong>scripts/server</strong> 
    create a file called <strong>cameraTrigger.cs</strong> and place the following code in it: </p>

<pre>
function CameraRoomTrigger::onEnterTrigger(%this,%trigger,%obj)
{
   // This method is called whenever an object enters the %trigger
   // area, the object is passed as %obj.
   // echo(" -- Trigger entered");
   
   %client = %obj.client;
   
   switch$(%trigger.name)
   {
      case "Room1":
         echo(" - entered room 1");
         %client.camera.position = Cam1.position;
         %client.camera.rotation = Cam1.rotation;
      
      case "Room2":
         echo(" - entered room 2");
         %client.camera.position = Cam2.position;
         %client.camera.rotation = Cam2.rotation;

      case "Room3":
         echo(" - entered room 3");
         %client.camera.position = Cam3.position;
         %client.camera.rotation = Cam3.rotation;

      case "Room4":
         echo(" - entered room 4");
         %client.camera.position = Cam4.position;
         %client.camera.rotation = Cam4.rotation;

      case "Room5":
         echo(" - entered room 5");
         %client.camera.position = Cam5.position;
         %client.camera.rotation = Cam5.rotation;

      case "Room6":
         echo(" - entered room 6");
         %client.camera.position = Cam6.position;
         %client.camera.rotation = Cam6.rotation;

      case "Room7":
         echo(" - entered room 7");
         %client.camera.position = Cam7.position;
         %client.camera.rotation = Cam7.rotation;
         
      default:
         echo(" -- Something is wrong with your room triggers");
   }
}</pre>

<p>Now open <strong>scripts/server/scriptExec.cs</strong> and add this code at the end of the file: </p>

<pre>
// Additional trigger code
exec("./cameraTrigger.cs");</pre>

<p>Save all of your scripts and restart your game.&nbsp; When the Empty Terrain 
    level loads your player should fall into Room1 and your camera should set itself 
    right where we want it.&nbsp; Click the right mouse button to move around the 
    area, moving up into the tower and across the bridge to test your camera angles 
    and trigger placement.&nbsp; You may need to move some of your triggers to 
    ensure that the camera angle changes at the right time.</p>

<p>If your cursor is hidden when you start the mission, simply open the 
    <strong>art/gui/playgui.gui</strong> file and at the beginning of the script you should find a 
    section that looks like this: </p>

<pre>
%guiContent = new GameTSCtrl(PlayGui) {
   cameraZRot = "0";
   forceFOV = "0";
   reflectPriority = "1";
   margin = "0 0 0 0";
   padding = "0 0 0 0";
   anchorTop = "1";
   anchorBottom = "0";
   anchorLeft = "1";
   anchorRight = "0";
   position = "0 0";
   extent = "1024 768";
   minExtent = "8 8";
   horizSizing = "right";
   vertSizing = "bottom";
   profile = "GuiContentProfile";
   visible = "1";
   active = "1";
   tooltipProfile = "GuiToolTipProfile";
   hovertime = "1000";
   isContainer = "1";
   canSave = "1";
   canSaveDynamicFields = "1";
      enabled = "1";
      helpTag = "0";
      noCursor = "1";</pre>

<p>Simply change the last line to <strong>noCursor = &quot;0&quot;;</strong> to show the cursor on startup.&nbsp; 
    The &#39;<strong>m</strong>&#39; key should toggle the cursor on and off unless you&#39;ve changed it from 
    the RTS Prototype settings.</p>
                  <p>Also, if you want to use the &quot;Adventure Camera&quot; mode you can change the 
                      <strong>commandToServer()</strong> in the <strong>GameCore::preparePlayer()</strong> function 
                      located in <strong>scripts/server/GameCore.cs</strong> from:</p>
<pre>
commandToServer('overheadCam');</pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre>commandToServer(&#39;actionCam&#39;);</pre>

<p>This will cause the camera to track the player through the scene from each of 
    the vantage points you have set up.</p>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By now you should have a fully functional Adventure camera system.  There are 
    several ways to improve upon this tutorial; for starters you could set up 
    invisible walls to keep the player from getting lost in the desert.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>There are 
    dozens of ways to showcase your level and this is just one of them.&nbsp; 
    Hopefully this article will give you some more ideas for camera and movement 
    systems and help you to make the games you want to make.</p>
