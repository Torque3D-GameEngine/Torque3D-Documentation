                <p>The Sketch Tool is a tool that allows you to quickly generate meshes
                  without going to 3rd party modeling applications, such as Maya or 3DS
                  Max. It is not meant to create final or game ready art, just rough
                  shapes that are placeholders for your real art. For example, you can use
                  this tool to sketch the shape of a building you want. The rough design
                  can fit your needs for a simple design and estimated measurements. </p><br>

                <p>This article was written using a newly generated project with the
                  Full Template, which ships with plenty of free assets for testing and
                  learning. To save time and focus on this specific section of the

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Creating a Convex Shape</span></h2>
                <p>The very basic interface allows you to quickly sketch out convex
                  shapes. All of your editing can be performed via mouse actions. To
                  begin creating a convex shape, hold down the Alt key and left mouse
                  button to begin drawing a base. The base will follow where your mouse
                  cursor is being dragged, shrinking or growing as it goes. </p>
                <p><br />

                <p><br />
                  Once you let go of your mouse button, the base will stop
                  growing. From here you can move your mouse cursor up and down to change
                  the height of your new box. You do not have to hold down the mouse
                  button during this time. </p>

                <p><br />
                  Once you are happy with your convex shape's height, left
                  click one last time. The box will become a solid object and
                  automatically be selected. If you make a mistake, hit Ctrl-Z to undo and erase the shape then repeat the process.
                  <p>
                  When you are ready to begin shaping the box,
                  left click one of its faces. The currently selected face will be
                  highlighted in bright pink: </p>

                <p><br />

                <p>Let's move some surfaces around. Start by selecting a faceof the object  by (left clicking on it). 
                Three colored lines will now extend from the center of that face - these represent the axes for the 
                three dimensions x, y and z. This is called the axis gizmo. Activate the Move Selection tool by clicking the icon
                <img alt="Image:move_selection_tool.png" src="images/move_selection_tool.png" border="0" height="24" width="27" />

                <p><br />
                  Once the Move Selection tool is activated, arrows will appear on the ends of the axis gizmo. Click on the X-axis
                  and drag it outward. Your face will move in the direction you are
                  dragging your mouse. The entire convex shape will adjust according to
                  where the face as moved. You will be able to move the face in any
                  direction in three-space: </p>

                  Next, activate the Rotate Selection tool by clicking the icon

                <p><br />
                  Click and hold one of the colored lines (an axis), and drag it in a direction. The selected face will begin to slope according to the new orientation: </p>

                <p><br />
                  Finally, activate the Scale Selection tool by clicking the icon 
                  <img alt="Image:scale_selection_tool.png" src="images/scale_selection_tool.png" border="0" height="26" width="26" />
                   on the Tools Palette on the left of the screen (or pressing the shortcut key, which is 3the number 4). Click on the
                  top face of the box. A squared like gizmo will appear which will allow you
                  to choose what parameters to adjust. You can adjust the (width, height, depth, or any 
                  combination of the three): </p>

                  Instead of adjusting one parameter at a time, we are going
                  to adjust width and height. Move your mouse over the different squares to see how they highlight. Click the bottom square of
                  the gizmo, in between the red X and yellow Y axis and hold down the mouse button. Drag your mouse in either direction
                  to shrink or grow the face. The more you shrink, the more like a
                  pyramid it will be come: </p>

                  The last action this guide will address is <b>extruding</b>.
                  The Sketch Tool extruding feature creates new geometry from a selected a

                <p><br />
                  Next click on a single face of the shape. Make sure you have a face selected, and not the entire object. 
                  The selected face should be highlighted with a in bright pink. Activate the Move Selection
                  tool. A hint will display at the bottom of the editor: "Move
                  selection. SHIFT while beginning a drag EXTRUDES a new convex." </p>

                <p><br />
                  Perform this action as described. With the face selected,
                  hold down the SHIFT key, move the mouse over one of the colored arrows, and click and drag outwards from the object. The
                  exact dimensions of the original face will be duplicated, constructing
                  a new convex based on those parameters. This may not be apparent until you click on a face and see that the area of the new face is separate from the original: </p>

                <p><br />
                  You can now select faces on the new convex object and continue editing it as a new object: </p>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Object Manipulation</span></h2>
                <p>When you are finished sculpting a convex shape, you can manipulate it as you would with any other
                  game object using the Object Editor. This includes selection, translation/rotation/scaling, and
                  editing specific properties. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Unlike the Sketch Tool, selecting a convex
                  shape using the Object Editor it treats the object as a whole. There is no
                  individual face selection. Switch to the Object Editor by pressing the F1 key then click on one of your objects: </p>
                <p><br />

                <p><br />
                  You may then manipulate the object using the normal Move Selection, Rotate Selection, 
                  and Scale Selection tools of the Object Editor. You can even use the other more complex 
                  Object Editor commands such as copying an object. To copy the 
                  object: hold the SHIFT key; activate the Move Selection tool 
                  by pressing (the 2 hotkey); press and hold the SHIFT key; then drag the mouse to a 
                  new position in any direction. When you release 
                  the mouse button you will have a new duplicate copy of the original object:  </p>

                  This can also be used for mass production of objects by copying multiple objects at once. 
                  Change back to the Select Arrow tool by pressing the (1 hotkey). 
                  Click one of your objects to select it. Take note of the position of the gizmo that appears 
                  and the little cube at the gizmo’s origin. Now select the other object. Again take note of 
                  the position of the gizmo and the cube for this object. Now press and hold down the SHIFT 
                  key then click your other object again. You will notice there are now two small cubes, 
                  one over each object, and one gizmo relatively near the center of the two objects. This 
                  indicates that both objects are currently selected. You now have a selection group. </p> 
                  <p>
                  Change to the Move Tool by pressing the (2 hotkey). The cubes will disappear, and large 
                  arrows will appear on the ends of the gizmo. If you mouse over either object, you will 
                  see a faint transparent cube pop up. This indicates that object is a part of the selection 
                  group. Clicking any arrow and dragging the mouse will not move all the objects at once. 
                  Likewise, pressing and holding down the 
                  SHIFT key, then clicking and drag will duplicate all the objects in the 
                  selection group:
                </p>
                <p><br />

                <p><br />
                  The new copy of the objects will now be the current selection and they 
                  can be moved as a group or immediately copied again with another SHIFT-drag 
                  operation. The above method combined with rearranging the individual objects 
                  after copying them is a great way to piece together multiple convex shapes 
                  to create more complex arrangements. For example, you might have unique convex 
                  objects for a roof, wall, chimney, and so on. You could only create 
                  one wall, then duplicate it four 
                  times so that they are all the same size then arrange them into a building 
                  with the Move Selection tool:  </p>

                <p>Once you get the hang of the Sketch Tool, you can sculpt unique
                  and complex shapes. Entire levels can be prototyped to use placeholder
                  art, created right inside Torque 3D, while you or your artists work on the final
                  assets using the tools that they are familiar with: </p>

                <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
                <p>Unless your game is specifically designed to make use of rough,
                  convex shapes, your main interaction with the Sketch Tool will be
                  limited to rapidly prototyping meshes within Torque 3D. It is
                  absolutely possible to create more advanced structures with time, but this
                  goes outside of the tool's focus. </p>
                <p><br />
                  Take time to experiment with the Sketch Tool. Find an image
                  of a structure you wish to recreate, such as a house or bunker. Try
                  sculpting the object in Torque 3D to see how close you can get to the
                  original image. From there you can then import that into a modeling 
                  application such as Maya or 3DS Max. You
                  may find this flow is actually very useful for content creation. </p>
